	Kalman Filter,
	state x is governed by the linear stochastic differential equation,
	x_(k) = A * x_(k-1) + B * u_(k-1) + w_(k-1),

	where x_(k) is the current state, for example, a point object's physical
	state is comprised by its position and velocity. 

	A is the state transition matrix

	x_(k-1) is the previous state.

	B is the control matrix related with optional control input u_(k-1)

	w_(k-1) is white noise with mean value 0 and covariance matrix Q.

	The measurement(observation) on the state x_(k) is given by
	z_(k) = H * x_(k) + v_(k)

	where z_(k) is the measurement(observation) and H is the observation matrix to
	map the real state to observation state
	
	A: 2D np_array, transition matrix
	B: 2D np_array, control matrix
	H: 2D np_array, observation matrix
	Q: 2D np_array, covariance matrix of the noise from the model
	R: 2D np_array, covaraince matrix of the noise from the measurement

	The above matrix is considered as constant here. 

	last_x: 1D np_array, previous state
	last_P: 2D np_array, previous error covariance matrix
	control: 1D np_array, optional control unit
	measureState: 1D np_array, measurement of the real state.
	x: 1D np_array, prior estimate of the state
	P: 2D np_array, prior error covariance matrix
	cur_x: 1D np_array, current estimate of the state
	cur_P: 2D np_array, current estimate error covaiance matrix
